Feature                           JavaScript
Type	         	     Scripting language, mostly interpreted
Platform	           Runs in web browsers (also Node.js for backend)
Use Case	           Web interactivity, frontend development, backend (Node.js)
Syntax	             Loosely typed, prototype-based
Compilation	         Interpreted by browsers or runtime
Concurrency          Uses event loop and callbacks (async/await)
File Extension	                  .js
Main Usage	        Interactive web pages, server-side JS

1996 - ECMA(European Computer Manufacture Association)
ECMA Script -> ES
1997 -> ES1
2015 -> ES6 ->

1995 to 2014 -> var(dataType)
ES6 -> let and const(dataType)







Naming conventions
  ->dont start with special characters
  -->utility-->csv-login.csv

 

 camelCase -->loginPage.js,variablenames, functionnames,methodnames
 pascalcase-->classnames --> LoginFunctionality
 

Primitive Types:

Number - Represents both integer and floating-point number
let age = 25;
let price = 99.99;

String - Represents textual data
let name = "Alice";
let greeting = 'Hello';


Boolean - Logical true/false values
let isActive = true;
let isComplete = false;

Null - Represents intentional absence of any object value
let emptyValue = null;

Undefined - Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value
let x;
console.log(x); // undefined











var vs let vs const:

Declaration & Basic Rules
Feature         	var	               let	                   const
Scope	       Function-scoped	      Block-scoped	           Block-scoped
Hoisting	   Hoisted (undefined)	  Hoisted (TDZ*)	         Hoisted (TDZ*)
Reassign	        ✅ Yes	            ✅ Yes	                   ❌ No
Redeclare	   ✅ Yes (same scope)	   ❌ No (same scope)	    ❌ No (same scope)

TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone): Cannot access before declaration (unlike var).


Best Practices:
Default to const (unless reassignment needed).
Use let for variables that change.
Avoid var (legacy code only).
Declare at the top of the scope to avoid TDZ issues.
